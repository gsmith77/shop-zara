# Shop Zara

Shop Zara was built to display my skills and knowledge with React, Redux, localStorage, creating a json server as well as being able to build an E-commerce web application. I will eventually use this as a pivoting point to be able to host my own shopify website to sell products.

## Cloning

run `git clone git@github.com:gsmith77/shop-zara.git` to clone the repo onto your computer.


### Deployment

run `json-server public/db.json --port 8000` to get database up and running.

Next

run `yarn start` to boot up the react server.


`yarn start` runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
